## Feature

## Installation
Currently, this extension is in the early stage of development,
and it isn't hosted on the Chrome Web Store yet.
So you need Chrome extension developer mode to install.

1. Copy extension files to anywhere you want.
2. Start Chrome
3. Open `chrome://extensions/` URL to show the Extension Management page.
   (Alternatively, from "Chrome menu" > "More Tools" > "Extensions")
4. Enable Developer Mode by a switch on right upper of the page.
5. Press the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory that you choose on step 1.
