2. Start Chrome
3. Open `chrome://extensions/` URL to show the "Extension Management" page.
   (Alternatively, from "Chrome menu" > "More Tools" > "Extensions")
4. Enable "Developer Mode" by a switch on right upper of the page.
5. Press the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory that you choose on step 1.
