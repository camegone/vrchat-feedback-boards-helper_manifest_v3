## What's this?

[VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com) runs the Feedback boards on [feedback.vrchat.com](https://feedback.vrchat.com/) to receive bug reports and feature requests and inform progresses of that. They uses the service of [Canny](https://canny.io/ "Canny: Customer Feedback Management Tool"). Sadly, searching UI of Canny is limited for end users. It's inconvenient. So, I made this little tool to improve it.

## What you can do

This tool provides query form and it opens Canny page for query result on other browser window (that is another tab).

What you can do with this tool are (I mean what you can't do on Canny's UI): 

- Specify search text and other conditions together. (Text and status filter etc. simultaneously) 
- "OR" condition of status for filtering. (Lists posts that have one of the specified statuses.)
- Limit result list to posts with "Open", "Closed" status. ("Open" has no reply from the dev. "Closed" is rejected one.)
- Use sort ordering "old". (most oldest post on the first)
- Reuse search condition clearly. (You can modify condition and try it again. You can get results on each separated window and compare these.)
- Search from all Boards.
- Store search conditions and reuse later.

## Setup for "search from all Boards"

To use "search from all Boards" feature you must allow popup window for this tool.
Check your browser's setting of "pop up blocker" in security section.

Though the detail depends on what browser you use, common and easy way is

1. Press "search (from all Boards)" button. Your browser can open only single window (tab), maybe.
2. Go back this tool window. Then your browser may show alert icon on tool bar.
3. Click the icon to show dialog.
4. Check "allow" box and confirm it.

## Limitation

- It's impossible to list posts that you originally wrote. Canny doesn't support such query. https://feedback.canny.io/feature-requests/p/show-my-posts https://feedback.canny.io/feature-requests/p/allow-users-to-pull-up-a-list-of-all-the-posts-theyve-made
- Canny seems to do some kind of fuzzy string searching. There's no way to exact matching. https://feedback.canny.io/feature-requests/p/offer-exact-search
- FYI: feature request for Caany about no way to search from all board in a single view https://feedback.canny.io/feature-requests/p/global-search-all-boards-to-avoid-duplicates )


## Appendix: Canny terminology

### Meaning of Sort options

Cite from [Canny help "Board Filters"](https://help.canny.io/en/articles/3827588-board-filters)

> - **Trending**: Sort the board by which posts have gotten the most votes recently. Most activity at the top.
> - **Top**: Sort by raw vote totals. Most votes at the top. Least votes at the bottom.
> - **MRR**: This option will sort posts by total MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) value. (NOTE: If multiple users from the same company vote on one post, the MRR value will not increase. The company's value is only counted once per post.) 
> - **Newest**: Sort the board in chronological order, newest posts first.
> - **Oldest**: Sort the board in chronological order, oldest posts first.

(VRChat seems not to use MRR. So I omit this option.)


### meaning of Status

Cite from [Canny help "Changing the status of a post"](https://help.canny.io/en/articles/673583-changing-the-status-of-a-post)

> - **Open** (No status)
> - **Under Review** (We are considering this)
> - **Planned** (We are planning to work on this)
> - **In Progress** (We are actively working on this)
> - **Complete** (We are done working on this)
> - **Closed** (We will not work on this)

(There seems to exist another status named "On Hold", but probably not to be used now.)
